## Classification Problem
### Classification Algorithms weâ€™re considering: SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

`For Dataset 1: For the first dataset, we are using Support Vector Machine. It had a 97% accuracy for this dataset which was the highest among the 5 algorithms we are considering. 
SVM is considered effective for high dimensional data, and with 3312 features and a relatively smaller number of samples (150 for training, 53 for testing), the ratio of features to samples is high making it high dimensional. Considering these reasons, we will move forward with SVM for the first dataset.`

`For Dataset 2: For this dataset, Random Forest seemed the most effective to us. 
Both SVM and Random Forest had a 95% accuracy which was the highest, however with 9182 features and a limited number of samples (100 for training and 74 for testing) with 11 classes, SVM could result in overfitting. Considering this challenge, using Random Forest might be more effective.`
